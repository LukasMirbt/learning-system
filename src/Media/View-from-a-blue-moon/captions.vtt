00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.187
The north shore of the Hawaiian island of Oahu

1
00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:25.317
is just over 2,400 miles from the west
coast of North America.

2
00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:30.147
The ocean floor rises five miles to the
shores of what people call,

3
00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.990
"The Seven Mile Miracle".

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.828
It's home to some of the most amazing
water and sand in the world.

5
00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.619
What would it be like to be born on this island,

6
00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.834
to grow up on these shores,

7
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.875
to witness this water everyday?

8
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.711
You're about to meet someone who did.

9
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.723
Here's John Florence and his birth certificate.

10
00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:47.680
He was born in Honolulu, on October 18th 1992.

11
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.641
This is where John grew up,

12
00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.693
this is John's office,

13
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.937
and this is a story about John John Florence.

14
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.994
John John Florence or whatever
isn't John John anymore.

15
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:12.544
He's just plain old John.

16
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.339
John has a tight-knit group of friends and
family living in the north shore of Oahu,

17
00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:19.206
also known as paradise.

18
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.507
Like John, Kelly is a world-class surfer.

19
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:31.432
He's also John's neighbor and pretty nosy.

20
00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:35.143
I'm thinking about maybe reporting
this illegal tree house

21
00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:38.225
to the authorities so it'll get chopped down.

22
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.860
Another world-class surfer neighbor is Jamie.

23
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.493
He and John were best of friends growing up.

24
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:49.491
Jamie was an asshole.

25
00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:52.833
He tied my board to the top of a coconut
tree in his yard one time,

26
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.829
and I was so bummed but Jamie was still
laughing the whole time.

27
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:59.291
Ouch! Rough neighborhood.

28
00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.714
Don't let the palm trees fool you.

29
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.809
John surfs from dawn to dusk
often into the night,

30
00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:15.729
everyday, ten hours a day.

31
00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:17.017
Or so he claims.

32
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.850
One wonders when he has time to workout.

33
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.395
I do not workout, I just surf.

34
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.280
In 2014, John nabbed the number one
spot in the surfer poll

35
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.858
from Kelly Slater after 20 plus years.

36
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.284
How many time has Kelly won now? 22 times?

37
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:34.503
Like, this is old as I am, yeah.

38
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.997
Here's a wave breaking.

39
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.514
Here's a wave breaking John.

40
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:50.548
While he was recuperating, he picked up
a less dangerous hobby.

41
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:52.474
So, I originally started flying.

42
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.682
I still had my pilot's license long before
I had my driver's license.

43
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.774
So John was a world-class surfer

44
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:01.149
and could fly before he could drive.

45
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:03.018
Thank god you don't need a license to sail.

46
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.278
This...is not John's boat.

47
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.700
This is.

48
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.738
John also plays the guitar.

49
00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.735
Ouch.

50
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.325
This is John's film storage
fridge in his dark room.

51
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.171
These are John's favorite cameras.

52
00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:22.998
I'll say I use this one the most.

53
00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:33.104
Already at 22 years old,

54
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:37.306
John has countless stamps to remind him of the
many places he has been to,

55
00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.269
places that most only dream of.

56
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.649
Um, sometimes I look back on the passport and,
yeah,

57
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:45.106
it does make me reminiscence,
rem-remi...remember.

58
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.570
So props to you, John,

59
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.780
for living the dream, living our wildest dreams.

60
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:56.742
Pipe dreams, wet dreams, sweet dreams,
broken dreams.

61
00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.155
For you, John, it's not a dream.

62
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.460
Dream on, John.

63
00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.046
What else do we need?

64
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.466
Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait,
hurry up and wait.

65
00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.466
I wonder if the road's as bumpy
as it used to be.

66
00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.506
Ah! There it is.

67
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.523
It's here.

68
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.676
- Holy shit.
-Enough size for it.

69
00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.265
-Look at this one.
-Look at that one.

70
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.440
That's just for one.

71
00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:44.898
-That's a nice one.
-Oh, damn it.

72
00:35:27.918 --> 00:35:31.298
We meet in an hour of change and challenge,

73
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:35.256
in a decade of hope and fear,

74
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.299
in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.

75
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:46.353
The greater our knowledge increases,

76
00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:48.983
the greater our ignorance unfolds.

77
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:53.646
...that all great and honorable actions

78
00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:56.782
are accompanied with great difficulties,

79
00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.370
and both must be enterprized and overcome

80
00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:03.158
with admirable courage.

81
00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:10.503
Many years ago, the great British explorer,
George Mallory,

82
00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:13.962
who was to die on Mount Everest,

83
00:36:13.964 --> 00:36:15.844
was asked why did he want to climb it.

84
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.260
He said, "Because it is there."

85
00:36:24.766 --> 00:36:26.726
Well, space is there,

86
00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:28.056
and we're going to climb it.

87
00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:34.192
And the moon and the planets are there,

88
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:38.824
and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.

89
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:45.908
And, therefore, as we set sail,
we ask God's blessing

90
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:50.002
on the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure

91
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.170
on which man has ever embarked.

92
00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:53.039
Thank you.

93
00:46:52.894 --> 00:46:54.064
Oh, look at the ocean.

94
00:46:55.605 --> 00:46:58.225
Oh, imagine some inside cruising.

95
00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:00.028
Oh, no hand.

96
00:47:00.026 --> 00:47:01.396
Oh, my gosh.

97
00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:03.775
See you later.

98
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.360
Should we go right here?

99
00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:06.624
I'm sure it's pointless to
walk all the way down.

100
00:47:06.616 --> 00:47:07.866
You end up right here anyway.

101
00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:38.028
And so, for now, our time with
John comes to an end.

102
00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:40.623
Any last words, John?

103
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:43.536
How about a wave?

104
00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:46.789
Not that kinda wave, John.

105
00:50:49.714 --> 00:50:50.764
That kind.

106
00:56:26.091 --> 00:56:29.721
Check one, check two, check three, check four.

107
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.680
Check 55, or not.

108
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:34.561
Yeah, well, for, you know, for me...

109
00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:36.678
-Oh, shit. Is it still going?
- Yeah.

110
00:56:36.685 --> 00:56:39.645
Everything I associated with
surfing in the ocean,

111
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:43.016
was 100% to do with my brother.

112
00:56:43.025 --> 00:56:47.985
He was my ultimate influence and I didn't
realize that until he was gone.

113
00:56:47.988 --> 00:56:53.658
A lot of drive, insight for surfing
kinda went with him.

114
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.910
It took years for me to find that
love for surfing again.

115
00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:59.044
It's through guys like John,

116
00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:02.381
seeing how he's evolved from a kid to a man,
to what he's doing now...

117
00:57:02.378 --> 00:57:06.758
That's what got me psyched, it made me wanna
reevaluate my whole surfing life.

118
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:10.131
I can't wait to see what's next.

119
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.510
Every session I go out with him, it's exciting,
it's already the future,

120
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.511
I see progressing with what he's doing.

121
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:40.273
For me, it's nice to be around that psyche,
that energy,

122
00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:43.637
and how damn good he surfs.

123
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:46.105
I think that's why I think why he
is where he is at,

124
00:58:46.106 --> 00:58:51.436
'cause the way he surfs and he draws these
lines that no one else draws.

125
00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:54.235
It's explosive, it's wild, it's
unorthodox and it's...

126
00:58:55.449 --> 00:58:56.369
It's John John.
