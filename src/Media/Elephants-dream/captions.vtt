00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.130
At the left we can see…

1
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:20.500
At the right we can see the—

2
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:21.980
…the head-snarlers.

3
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:24.550
Everything is safe… Perfectly safe.

4
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:25.770
Emo?

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.220
Emo?

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.104
Watch out!

7
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.260
Are you hurt?

8
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.200
I don’t think so. You?

9
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.090
I’m OK.

10
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:01.110
Get up, Emo! It’s not safe here.

11
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.229
Let’s go.

12
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.190
What’s next?

13
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.960
You’ll see!

14
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.840
You’ll see!

15
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.480
Emo! This way.

16
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.480
Follow me!

17
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.521
Hurry, Emo!

18
00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:50.063
You’re not paying attention!

19
00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:54.313
I–I just want to answer the phone.

20
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.040
Emo, look… I mean, listen.

21
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.000
You have to learn to listen.

22
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.040
This is not some game.

23
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:09.180
You… I mean, <i>we</i>. We could easily die out here.

24
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.396
Listen… Listen to the sounds of the machine.

25
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.000
Listen to your breathing.

26
00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:29.313
Well, don’t you ever get tired of this?

27
00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:31.090
Tired!?

28
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.313
Emo, the machine is like…

29
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.260
Like clockwork!

30
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.063
One move out of place…

31
00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:39.120
…and you’re ground to a pulp.

32
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.104
But isn’t it—

33
00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:46.030
Pulp, Emo! Is that what you want? <i>Pulp</i>?

34
00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:50.420
Emo, your goal in life…

35
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.950
…pulp!?

36
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.420
Emo, close your eyes.

37
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.396
–Why?
–Now!

38
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.970
OK.

39
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.680
Good.

40
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.100
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

41
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.000
–Nothing.
–Really?

42
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:07.580
No, nothing at all.

43
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.980
Really? A–And at your right? What do you see at your right side, Emo?

44
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.840
The same, Proog. Exactly the same…

45
00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:19.896
–…nothing!
–Great.

46
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.720
Listen, Proog! Do you hear that?

47
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.560
Can we go here?

48
00:06:45.063 --> 00:06:46.560
–There?
–Yeah!

49
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.188
It isn’t safe, Emo.

50
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.010
–B–But…
–Trust me, it’s not.

51
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.170
Well, maybe I could…

52
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:55.146
No.

53
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.820
–But…
–No!

54
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.240
No!

55
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.050
Any further questions, Emo?

56
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.090
N–No.

57
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.080
Emo?

58
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.080
Emo, why!?

59
00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:15.360
Emo, why…?

60
00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:18.840
Why can’t you see the beauty of this place?

61
00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:20.646
The way it works.

62
00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:23.920
How… How <i>perfect</i> it is.

63
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.040
No, Proog, I don’t see.

64
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:29.970
I don’t see because there’s nothing there.

65
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.240
And why should I trust my life to something that isn’t there?

66
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:36.600
Well, can you tell me that?

67
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:37.380
Emo…

68
00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:38.920
Answer me!

69
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.000
Proog…

70
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.854
…you’re a sick man!

71
00:07:46.855 --> 00:07:48.910
Stay away from me!

72
00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:54.854
No! Emo! It’s a trap!

73
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.979
Hah, “it’s a trap!”

74
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.229
At the left side you can see the Hanging Gardens of Babylon!

75
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.950
How’s that for a trap?

76
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.920
No, Emo.

77
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.640
At the right side you can see—well guess what…

78
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:14.660
…the Colossus of Rhodes!

79
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.390
No!

80
00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:20.160
The Colossus of Rhodes! And it is here just for you, Proog.

81
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:21.688
Just for you!

82
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.021
It is there…

83
00:08:53.022 --> 00:08:56.040
I’m telling you, Emo…

84
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.860
…it is… there…
